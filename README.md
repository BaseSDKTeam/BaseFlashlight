BaseFlashlight
==============

This is a sample project of the BASE Flashlight app. We designed a simple flashlight that has no special features and implemented it with the BaseSDK technology. By using the device's sensors, BaseSDK recognizes a sudden drop in lighting and let the sdk users know when it happens. Once we get the sudden light change event we opens the flashlight, not before we are checking with BaseSDK that the user is not currently driving (who need a flashlight while driving?).

This is just one example of using BaseSDK. Every developer can use BaseSDK to implement cool features, so it's basically up to you!

Where do I get BaseSDK?
-----------------------

To get BaseSDK, just head over to the [BaseSDK Website](http://basesdk.com/) and start coding!
