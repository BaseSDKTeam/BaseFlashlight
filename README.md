BaseFlashlight
==============

This is a sample project of flashlight application that demonstrates how many of the BaseSDK capabilities can easily improve your application. 
By integrating BaseSDK you will be capable to determine your user gender, activities, geo locations etcâ€¦
In current example, BaseSDK notifies the flashlight about sudden light change around the device so that the flashlight could automatically turn on.
To demonstrate other SDK features the flashlight checks if the user is not driving just to make sure the flashlight is not turned on while the user is driving through tunnel.

This is just one example of using BaseSDK. Every developer can use BaseSDK to implement cool features, so it's basically up to you!
